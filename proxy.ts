 * streamed behind the already-sent static shell: a full load answers 200 with an empty body, and a
 * client-side navigation to it never commits, so "Oyun yarat" looked dead while signed out. A 307
 * here happens before any rendering and works the same for full loads, navigations and prefetches.
 *
 * Only cookie presence is checked, so this stays free of database and crypto work. A cookie that is
 * present but no longer valid falls through to the page's own check.
