# OyunaGəl API

The homepage, game and venue endpoints live under `/api/v1`. Payload's own REST API (collections, auth) stays at `/api/*`, which is why the two don't share paths: a custom `/api/games` route would shadow Payload's and break the admin panel.

All times in responses are ISO 8601 UTC. Every display label (`dateLabel`, `timeLabel`, `relativeTimeLabel`, `sportLabel`, `levelLabel`, `venue.label`) is computed server-side in `Asia/Baku`, so the frontend never does timezone math.

Errors always have the shape:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "GAME_FULL", "message": "Oyunda boş yer qalmayıb." } }
```

| Daxil ol                                | Google only, see [Accounts](#accounts)               |

Joining and creating games require a signed-in account. The create form asks for the host's phone (prefilled from the profile); the host name is taken from the account. The join modal is a two-step wizard: step 1 collects the player's name and phone, step 2 shows the host and sends them.

## Game status

Every game carries a server-computed `status` and `remainingSpots` (`lib/game-backend.ts` → `deriveAvailability`). Display these; never recompute them from the counts.

| `status`    | Meaning                                          | Joinable |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `open`      | Upcoming and at least one spot left              | yes      |
| `full`      | Upcoming, no spots left                          | no       |
| `closed`    | Start time has passed but status not yet updated | no       |
| `live`      | In progress                                      | no       |
| `finished`  | Over                                             | no       |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled                                        | no       |

## Game card

Returned by the list, featured and detail endpoints.

```json
{
  "id": "12",
  "title": "Cümə axşamı 5-ə-5",
  "sport": "football",
  "sportLabel": "Futbol",
  "level": "medium",
  "levelLabel": "Orta səviyyə",
  "venue": {
    "id": "3",
    "name": "Aku Arena",
    "label": "Aku Arena — Nizami, Bakı",
    "district": "Nizami",
    "address": "Nizami, Bakı",
    "city": "baku",
    "cityLabel": "Bakı",
    "coordinates": { "lat": 40.4, "lng": 49.87 },
    "sportTypes": ["football"]
  },
  "district": "Nizami",
  "startsAt": "2026-08-02T16:00:00.000Z",
  "dateLabel": "Baz, 2 Avq",
  "timeLabel": "20:00",
  "relativeTimeLabel": "Bu gün · 20:00",
  "currentCount": 11,
  "maxCount": 12,
  "remainingSpots": 1,
  "status": "open",
  "coverImageUrl": "/api/media/file/cover-1600x900.webp",
  "coverImage": {
    "thumbnailUrl": "/api/media/file/cover-480x270.webp",
    "fullUrl": "/api/media/file/cover-1600x900.webp",
    "fallbackUrl": "/images/game-football-1-7880cc.png"
  },
  "host": { "id": "4", "name": "Elvin Abbasov", "initials": "EA", "avatarUrl": null }
}
```

- The card line "Aku Arena · Nizami, Bakı · Orta səviyyə" is `venue.name · venue.district, venue.cityLabel · levelLabel`.
- "6/10 oyunçu" / "4 yer qalıb" are `currentCount/maxCount` and `remainingSpots`.
- `relativeTimeLabel` is `Bu gün · HH:mm`, `Sabah · HH:mm`, the weekday within the week, or the date beyond it.
- `coverImage.fallbackUrl` is always the sport's default image, for an `onError` handler.
- `host.id` is what the host's name links to (`/users/{id}`, see [`GET /api/v1/users/{id}`](#get-apiv1usersid)).
  It is `null` only for a game whose host account no longer exists.

## `GET /api/v1/sports`

Sport tabs. Every known sport is listed, including those with no open games.

| Query  | Default | Notes                                        |
| ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `city` | `baku`  | `baku` or `Bakı`. Unknown → `400 UNKNOWN_CITY` |

```json
[
  { "sport": "football", "label": "Futbol", "iconKey": "football", "openGamesCount": 18 },
  { "sport": "basketball", "label": "Basketbol", "iconKey": "basketball", "openGamesCount": 9 },
  { "sport": "tennis", "label": "Tennis", "iconKey": "tennis", "openGamesCount": 7 }
]
```

Only `open` games count. The query is cached (Next data cache, tag `games`, refreshed at least every 60 s). Any game, venue or participant change and every successful join expire it immediately.

## `GET /api/v1/games`

The "bu gün / sabah" grid and the "Hamısına bax" list, soonest first.

| Query    | Default                    | Notes                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sport`  | all                        | `football`, `basketball`, `tennis`. Else `400 INVALID_SPORT` |
| `city`   | `baku`                     | As above                                                     |
| `from`   | now                        | ISO 8601 with offset, e.g. `2026-09-14T00:00:00+04:00`. Clamped to now: started games are never listed |
| `to`     | end of tomorrow, Baku time | ISO 8601, exclusive. Pass a later date for "Hamısına bax"    |
| `status` | open and full              | `open` → only games with spots left                          |
| `page`   | `1`                        | 1-based                                                      |
| `limit`  | `12`                       | 1–50                                                         |

```json
{
  "games": [{ "…": "game card" }],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 12, "totalDocs": 30, "totalPages": 3, "hasNextPage": true }
}
```

**Pagination** is page-based: "Daha çox" requests `page + 1` and appends; hide it when `hasNextPage` is `false`. `totalDocs`/`totalPages` reflect the filters.

## `GET /api/v1/games/featured`

Hero-carousel games: game cards plus a participant preview for the avatar stack.

| Query   | Default | Notes    |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| `city`  | `baku`  | As above |
| `limit` | `8`     | 1–8      |

**Ranking.** Candidates are `open` games starting within the next 7 days, each scored

```
score = 0.6 × (1 − hoursUntilStart / 168) + 0.4 × (currentCount / maxCount)
```

so games that start soon and are nearly full rank first. Ties go to the earlier start.

```json
{
  "games": [
    {
      "…": "game card",
      "participants": {
        "preview": [{ "name": "Elvin Abbasov", "initials": "EA", "avatarUrl": "/api/media/file/elvin.png" }],
        "total": 11
      }
    }
  ],
  "totalDocs": 1
}
```

`preview` holds up to the first 5 players who joined through the join endpoint, oldest first. Show `avatarUrl` when set, else `initials`. The "+N" bubble is `total − preview.length`.

## `GET /api/v1/games/{id}`

"Oyun Detalı". Signing in is optional.

```json
{
  "…": "game card",
  "host": { "id": "4", "name": "Elvin Abbasov", "initials": "EA", "avatarUrl": null, "phone": null },
  "participants": { "preview": [{ "name": "…", "initials": "RM", "avatarUrl": null }], "total": 11 },
  "viewer": { "joined": false, "isHost": false }
}
```

`host.phone` is `null` until the viewer has joined (or is the host), matching "Əlaqə oyuna qoşulduqdan sonra görünür". The button reads "Qoşul - {remainingSpots} yer qalıb" while `status` is `open`. `404 GAME_NOT_FOUND` for unknown IDs.

## `PATCH /api/v1/games/{id}`

"Oyunu redaktə et". **Host only** (admins too); everyone else gets `403`.

Body is the create-game form minus `currentCount`: `sport`, `level`, `venueId`, `scheduledDate`,
`scheduledTime`, `maxCount`, `hostPhone` and an optional `title`. Who is in the game is decided by
who joined, not by the host editing a number, so `currentCount` is ignored if sent — only the free
spots move when `maxCount` changes.

**200** returns `{ "game": { … } }`, the same shape as `GET /api/v1/games/{id}`.

| Status | `code`                    | When                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 400    | `MAX_COUNT_BELOW_PLAYERS` | `maxCount` is lower than the players already in the game     |
| 400    | `INVALID_MAX_COUNT`       | Not even, or past the sport's limit (e.g. 10 players, tennis)|
| 400    | `DATE_IN_PAST`            | The new start time has already passed                        |
| 400    | `VENUE_SPORT_MISMATCH`    | The venue does not host the chosen sport                      |
| 401    | `UNAUTHENTICATED`         | Not signed in                                                 |
| 403    | `NOT_GAME_HOST`           | Signed in, but not this game's host                           |
| 404    | `GAME_NOT_FOUND`          |                                                               |

## `DELETE /api/v1/games/{id}`

"Oyunu sil". **Host only** (admins too). Deletes the game and every participant row pointing at it —
the foreign key is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so the participants have to be removed explicitly or they
are left orphaned and keep turning up in counts. Both happen in one transaction.

Join attempts are kept: `join_attempts.gameId` is a plain number, so the audit log survives the game.

**200** returns `{ "ok": true, "id": "12" }`. Errors are the `401` / `403` / `404` rows above.

## `POST /api/v1/games/{id}/join`

"Oyuna qoşul". Requires a signed-in user (Payload session or Google session cookie).

Body: `{ "name": "Kərim Məmmədov", "phone": "+994 50 210 34 56" }` — what step 1 of the join modal collected. Both are re-validated server-side; either one left out falls back to the profile's value, and a `400` follows if the profile has none.

A `phone` sent is kept on the profile (see [Remembered phone number](#remembered-phone-number)) when the profile has none, or when `"saveToProfile": true` asks to replace it.

**200** also returns the full game detail, now with `host.phone`:

```json
{
  "id": "12",
  "status": "full",
  "remainingSpots": 0,
  "currentCount": 12,
  "maxCount": 12,
  "game": { "…": "as GET /api/v1/games/{id}", "host": { "name": "Elvin Abbasov", "phone": "+994502103456" } },
  "savedToProfile": false
}
```

The spot is taken when this request succeeds. The "Bir addım qaldı" modal then closes and the page reloads its data, which shows the new count and the host's phone.

| Status | `code`              | When                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `INVALID_GAME_ID`   | `id` is not a positive integer                            |
| 400    | `INVALID_NAME`      | No name given and the profile has none                    |
| 400    | `INVALID_PHONE`     | `phone` isn't an Azerbaijani number, or none is known     |
| 401    | `UNAUTHENTICATED`   | Not signed in: send the user to "Daxil ol"                |
| 404    | `GAME_NOT_FOUND`    |                                                           |
| 409    | `GAME_FULL`         | No spots left, including losing a race for the last spot  |
| 409    | `GAME_NOT_JOINABLE` | Cancelled, finished, live, or already started             |
| 409    | `ALREADY_JOINED`    | This user already holds a spot                            |

**Concurrency.** The spot is claimed with one conditional `UPDATE … WHERE available_players > 0` inside a transaction (`lib/join-game.ts`). Postgres re-checks the condition after the row lock is released, so when two requests race for the last spot, exactly one succeeds and the other gets `409 GAME_FULL`, across any number of app instances. A unique `(game, user)` index prevents double joins, and a rejected join rolls the decrement back. Every attempt is written to the `join-attempts` collection (outcome, game, user, IP), readable by admins.

## `GET /api/v1/venues`

Options for the "Meydança" picker.

| Query   | Default | Notes                                                   |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `city`  | `baku`  | As above                                                |
| `sport` | all     | Venues offering that sport (venues with no sports set are always included) |
| `q`     | none    | Search in name, district and address; ignores case and Azerbaijani letters (`inter`, `nerimanov`) |

```json
[{ "id": "3", "name": "Aku Arena", "label": "Aku Arena — Nizami, Bakı", "district": "Nizami", "…": "as venue above" }]
```

## `POST /api/v1/games`

"Yeni Oyun Yarat" → "Oyunu dərc et". Requires a signed-in user, who becomes the host and, in the same transaction, the game's first participant.

```json
{
  "sport": "Futbol",
  "level": "Orta",
  "venueId": 3,
  "scheduledDate": "2026-08-04",
  "scheduledTime": "17:00",
  "currentCount": 1,
  "maxCount": 10,
  "hostPhone": "+994 50 210 34 56",
  "title": "Cümə axşamı 5-ə-5"
}
```

| Field           | Notes                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sport`         | `football`/`basketball`/`tennis` or the labels `Futbol`/`Basketbol`/`Tennis` |
| `level`         | `beginner`/`medium`/`high` or `Başlanğıc`/`Orta`/`Yüksək`                  |
| `venueId`       | From `GET /api/v1/venues`                                                  |
| `scheduledDate`, `scheduledTime` | Baku local time, `YYYY-MM-DD` and `HH:mm`; must be in the future |
| `currentCount`  | "Mövcud iştirakçı sayı": players already in, including the host, `1 … maxCount − 1` (0 or missing counts as 1). The game opens with `maxCount − currentCount` spots |
| `maxCount`      | Even (two equal sides), from 2 up to the sport's full size: football 22, basketball 10, tennis 4 |
| `hostPhone`     | Optional if the profile has a phone number; shown to players after they join |
| `title`         | Optional, defaults to "Futbol oyunu" etc. (the design has no title field)  |
| `saveToProfile` | Optional `true`: also replace the profile's number with `hostPhone` (see [Remembered phone number](#remembered-phone-number)) |

The host name ("Ad Soyad (Host)") comes from the account, so show it read-only.

**201** `{ "game": { …as GET /api/v1/games/{id} }, "savedToProfile": true }`. Errors: `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`; `400` with `INVALID_SPORT`, `INVALID_LEVEL`, `INVALID_VENUE`, `INVALID_DATE`, `DATE_IN_PAST`, `INVALID_MAX_COUNT`, `INVALID_CURRENT_COUNT`, `INVALID_PHONE`, `VENUE_NOT_FOUND`, `VENUE_SPORT_MISMATCH`, `PHONE_REQUIRED`.

### Remembered phone number

The create form and the join modal start from the profile's number, so the number someone types is
kept there for next time: after a successful create or join, the `hostPhone` / `phone` sent becomes
the profile's number **when the profile has none**. A different number already on the profile is
only replaced when the body carries `"saveToProfile": true` (the forms' "Bu nömrəni profilimdə
saxla" checkbox). A number another account holds is never taken — numbers are unique per account —
and a failure here never fails the create or join. `savedToProfile` in the response says whether the
profile changed; the client then calls the `expireSession` Server Action so the header and the next
form don't keep showing the session it had cached.

## `POST /api/v1/games/{id}/leave`

"Oyundan çıx". Requires a signed-in user and hands the spot back to the game. Allowed right up to
kick-off. The host cannot leave their own game — they delete it instead.

The participant row is deleted first, and the spot only returned when that DELETE actually removed
something, so calling this repeatedly cannot push `available_players` past `max_players` and invent
places in a full game. Response body matches the join endpoint.

| Status | `code`              | When                                                  |

| 409    | `GAME_STARTED`      | Already kicked off, cancelled or finished             |

## Profile

### `GET /api/v1/me`

The signed-in user's profile in one request. Use this rather than Payload's `/api/users/me`, which
also hands the client `role`, `googleId`, `loginAttempts` and `lockUntil`.

```json
{
  "id": "12", "fullName": "Kərim Məmmədov", "firstName": "Kərim", "initials": "KM",

- `hostingUpcoming` / `joinedUpcoming` match the upcoming lists of `GET /api/v1/me/games`.
- `hostedPast` and `played` are games that are over and were not cancelled: hosted ones, and joined
  ones the user did not host. A game is counted in exactly one of them.
- `stats.playedBySport` counts both, per sport, so it adds up to `stats.totalPlayed` =
  `played + hostedPast`.
- `memberSinceLabel` is the Baku calendar month the account was created, for "Qeydiyyat: fevral 2026".
- `avatarUrl` is the uploaded picture if there is one (`hasUploadedPicture`), else the Google picture
  saved at sign-in (`googleAvatarUrl`), else `null` (show `initials`).

### `PATCH /api/v1/me`

Body may carry any of `fullName`, `phone`, `profilePictureId`; only the keys sent are changed, so a
patch never blanks a field it did not mention. `null` (or `""`) clears `phone` / `profilePictureId`.
Phones go through the same `normalizePhone` as everywhere else, so `055 987 65 43` is stored as
`+994559876543` and matches numbers saved by the join form.

`email`, `role` and `googleId` are not editable — they are what tie the account to its Google
identity. A body with only those comes back as `NOTHING_TO_UPDATE`.

**200** returns `{ "profile": { … } }`, as `GET /api/v1/me`.

| Status | `code`               | When                                        |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 400    | `INVALID_NAME`       | Empty, or over 120 characters               |
| 400    | `INVALID_PHONE`      | Not an Azerbaijani number                   |
| 400    | `INVALID_MEDIA`      | `profilePictureId` is not a valid upload id |
| 400    | `MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`    | No such upload, or one this user did not upload |
| 400    | `NOTHING_TO_UPDATE`  | No editable field was sent                  |
| 409    | `PHONE_TAKEN`        | Another account already holds that number   |

Uploading the picture itself is Payload's `POST /api/media` (signed-in only, see [Uploads](#uploads));
send the returned id as `profilePictureId`. Only an upload of the user's own is accepted — a venue photo
or someone else's avatar gets `MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`, as if it did not exist. The picture it replaces (or
that `null` removes) is deleted, file and all, when this user uploaded it.

### `DELETE /api/v1/me`

Deletes the account, **and the games it hosts**. That is not optional: `games.host_id` is
ON DELETE SET NULL and `host` is a required field, so removing the user alone would leave hosted
games with no host — records nobody can edit or delete, still listed and still carrying a contact
number. Their participants go too, and so do this user's own participations. Each spot the user
held in someone else's upcoming game is handed back, as if they had left it; past games keep their
numbers. One transaction. The pictures the user uploaded are deleted after it commits (files can't
be rolled back).

Returns `{ "ok": true, "deletedGames": 1 }` and clears both session cookies.

### `GET /api/v1/me/games`

The profile's game lists, in the same card shape as `GET /api/v1/games`.

| Query  | Default    | Notes                                                             |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role` | `joined`   | `joined` or `hosting`. `joined` excludes games the viewer hosts   |
| `when` | `upcoming` | `upcoming` (soonest first) or `past` (most recent first)          |
| `page` | `1`        | 1-based                                                           |
| `limit`| `12`       | 1–50                                                              |

### `GET /api/v1/users/{id}`

Another player's public profile — open to anyone, because it carries only what a game card already
shows about its host, plus the games they are running. Never their email or phone: a host's number
stays gated behind joining the game (`GET /api/v1/games/{id}`).

```json
{
  "id": "12", "fullName": "Kərim Məmmədov", "firstName": "Kərim", "initials": "KM", "avatarUrl": "…",
  "memberSince": "…", "memberSinceLabel": "fevral 2026", "counts": { "hostingUpcoming": 2, "hostedPast": 7 },
  "hostedGames": [{ "…": "game card" }]
}
```

`404 USER_NOT_FOUND` for an id that does not exist.

## Accounts

Payload's built-in auth endpoints on the `users` collection:

**Google is the only way in.** There is no email/password form and no separate sign-up screen: the
account is created on first Google sign-in. `POST /api/users` is admin-only, so nothing can register
an account another way.

| Screen              | Request                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Daxil ol            | Link to `/api/auth/google`. The callback verifies the code with Google server-side, requires a verified email, and creates the account on first sign-in (name, email, profile picture), then sets the `google_session` cookie |
| Current user        | `GET /api/users/me`                                                                     |
| Log out             | `POST /api/users/logout` (Payload session) **and** `POST /api/auth/logout` (Google session cookie) |

Users can only read and edit their own account. Payload's own email/password login stays enabled for
the `/admin` panel, but no public screen uses it.

## Unused surfaces

- The `teams` collection and the `homeTeam` / `awayTeam` / `homeScore` / `awayScore` fields on games
  are not read by any endpoint or screen; only `scripts/seed.ts` writes them.
- `game-participants` is no longer publicly readable: a user reads their own rows, admins read all.
  Everything the app renders from it (avatar stacks, counts, "my games") runs with `overrideAccess`,
  so this only closes the REST route that let anyone enumerate one person's games.
- GraphQL is disabled (`graphQL: { disable: true }`): `/api/v1` is the only data surface.

## Uploads

`POST /api/media` (multipart: `file`, plus `_payload` = `{"alt": "…"}`) is open to any signed-in user.

- **Types:** JPEG, PNG and WebP only (`400` otherwise). SVG is refused because it is a document that
  can carry script and would be served from the site's own origin.
- **Size:** at most 4 MB (`413`, "Şəkil 4 MB-dan böyük ola bilməz."), below Vercel's 4.5 MB request
  limit, which would otherwise answer with a bare error page.
- **Ownership:** the server records the uploader in `uploadedBy` and ignores any value sent. Only the
  uploader or an admin can `PATCH` or `DELETE /api/media/{id}`; everyone else gets `403`. Uploads from
  before `uploadedBy` existed (migration `20260925_065346_media_uploaded_by`) belong to nobody, so only
  admins can change them.

## Images

Uploads to `media` get `thumbnail` (480×270) and `full` (≤1600 wide) WebP renditions. Render them with `next/image`, which also serves AVIF to browsers that accept it. Set `MEDIA_BASE_URL` (a CDN in front of the app, or later an S3 bucket via `@payloadcms/storage-s3`) to get CDN URLs. A game's cover is resolved most-specific-first: its own uploaded `coverImage`, then its `image`
path, then **the venue's `image`** (so a game at a venue with a photo shows that place rather than
stock art), then the sport's default picture. `coverImage.fallbackUrl` stays the sport default, so a
venue photo that fails to load still degrades to something sensible.
